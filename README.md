### Google DevFest MN - Feb 2017

install docker

install TensorFlow 0.11

```
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow
```

##### Graphs
Nodes can be
- Data Nodes
- Operations
- Summaries

```
tensorboard --logdir-/tmp/first_graph
```

- look into running tensorflow on top of spark
- tensorboard is your friend
